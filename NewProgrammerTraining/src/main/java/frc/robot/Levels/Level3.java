 * =================================================================================================
 * LEVEL 3: LIVE INPUTS, CALCULATIONS, AND LOOPS
 * =================================================================================================
 *
 * This level teaches you the core logic loop of a robot: reading live data,
 * thinking (doing math), and showing the result.
 *
 * You will learn how to:
 *   - Read numbers that a user types into the Elastic dashboard.
 *   - Perform a simple calculation with those numbers.
 *   - Run code over and over in a continuous loop to create a live-updating display.
 *
 * This is the fundamental pattern of all robotics:
 *   READ SENSORS  ->  THINK/CALCULATE  ->  CONTROL MOTORS
 *
 * In this level, your keyboard and the dashboard are the "sensors," and the "Sum"
 * display is your "motor."
 *
 * ---
 *
 * YOUR GOAL:
 *  - Make a simple calculator. Read two numbers from the dashboard, add them
 *    together, and display the result in a "Sum" widget.
 *
 * =================================================================================================
 *
 * ===>  VERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THIS LEVEL  <===
 *
 * When you simulate this code, you will need to type numbers into the dashboard.
 * If you use the "real DriverStation," pressing the Enter key on your keyboard will
 * also DISABLE the robot, which is very frustrating.
 *
 * TO AVOID THIS PROBLEM:
 * When you select "WPILib: Simulate Robot Code":
 *   - A small pop-up will appear at the top of VS Code.
 *   - **DO NOT** check the box for "Use real DriverStation".
 *   - Just click "OK" with the box unchecked.
 *
 * A simulated Driver Station will appear on your screen for you to enable the robot.
 *
 * =================================================================================================
 *
 * STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
 *
 *   1. Build and Simulate your code (remember the note above!).
 *
 *   2. In Elastic, use the "Level Select" widget to choose "Level 3".
 *
 *   3. Find the new widgets for this level. They will be under the SmartDashboard dropdown
 *      and will be named "Number A", "Number B", and "Sum".
 *
 *   4. Drag all three widgets onto your dashboard.
 *
 *   5. Double-click the value box for "Number A" and "Number B" and type in a number.
 *      Press Enter to confirm.
 *
 *   6. Now, go to the `run()` method below and complete the TODOs. Your job is to make
 *      the "Sum" widget correctly show the sum of A + B.
 *
 *   7. The level will automatically pass once your calculation is correct.
 *
